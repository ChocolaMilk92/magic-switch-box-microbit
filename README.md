# Magic Switch Box with Micro:bit
My magic switch box project worked on with my groupmate in college

This project aimed to showcase creativity and teamwork while utilizing the **Micro:bit**, a small yet powerful microcontroller for interactive projects.

This was my first project in college, please apologize for any mistakes or imperfections.
